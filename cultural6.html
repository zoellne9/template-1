			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>

			<p>Well I do not think people will like this day, in fact only a few people will actually follow the rules, if any. Maybe it should be one day of every mouth. This way people who did it the first time can spread the word so then it is still fresh in people’s minds when the next day comes around. It will take a long time but people should eventually open up to the idea. Hopefully the older generations who like to call with try to convince my generation and the parents to start to watch what their kids are using their phones for. I also hope that parents will realize that their children do not need phone to call until they are in middle school, I only had a phone to call my parents in middle school. Then in high school add texting, this is what happened to me. And finally in college kids can get smart phones if they feel they really need them. I never got one and do not need it and I am glad I did not get one. And finally to put a finishing touch, I hope kids will realize from the screen free day that having a smart phone does not mean you’re a cool and popular kid. It is not the stuff you have, it is the friends you have. But if you have your nose in a phone you can make that many real friends. Kids cannot be taught this, they need to acknowledge this themselves in order for the change to happen. </p>
