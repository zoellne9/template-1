			<h1>Technology</h1>

			<p>Here in Michigan we have a very special climate. We have the lake effect so it creates a false climate. The lakes can trap heat so in the winter in not as cold as it should be because the heat is released and then with no heat the lakes are cooler so the summers are not as hot because the heat is trap in the lakes. This makes it so Michigan does not have as harsh of climate as we should have. Even with this false climate Michigan we are still limited on plants we can grow. We specialize in tart cherries, pumpkins, blueberries, and pickling cucumbers. But how do we grow fruits like tomatoes, yes they are fruits, and peppers. Well we could not grow them without technology! Probably the most important part of technology in Horticulture is a greenhouse. This is because it can let us grow tomatoes and peppers. See they are warm season crop so we cannot start to grow them outside till the end of May and if we grew them from seeds they would get into flower right when the frost is coming. So greenhouses fix this problem and allow us to start them earlier indoors. See greenhouse create a false climate by trapping heat that passes through the glass. Green houses are amazing because they create an even more diverse climate range in Michigan. Tractors and large irrigation systems are also a big part too because without them we could not grow on large scales.</p>
