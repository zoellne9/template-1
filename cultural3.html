			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>

			<p>Phones were meant to bring us together by allowing a person to contact another person from far away in an instant. But think how one person actually communicates with someone else… we sometimes call, most of the older generations do, but most of the time we text, which is most of what my generation does. If you just analyze what actually happens when you text, a text shows cannot even face a person to talk to them. Yes it is ok to ask a person where they are or what they are doing but having a full on conversation over texting is absurd. A person’s confidence is dropping with ever text sent almost by the second, it seems, because now a boy will ask out or break up with girls over text so they do not have to face the embarrassment or sadness. It severely cuts confidents of people when it comes down to it. This is because it takes a lot of confidence to talk to someone new and it is naturally hard to talk to people you don’t know. It can even be hard to people you know because you do not want to talk weird or have things be awkward. Texting can make communicating easier because it happens slower them actually talking. This in turn gives time to the person to respond. It sounds lovely does it not? But in reality a conversation is much faster and you need to be able to analyze a conversation fast, and texting takes this practice of learning to deal with a difficult situation away. It is way easier to talk to someone when there is no awkwardness and easier to get away if your just texting, you do not have to actually see their response and know how your comment affects them. You cannot put emotions into texting. It sounds like a good thing but think, do you want a true friend or someone who you talk to through a phone and your image of them is just words on your phone. This not a healthy relationship.</p>
