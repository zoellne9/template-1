			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>

			<p>For a solution to over cell phone use parents need to keep watch of their kids’ intake of a phone usage or just not give a phone to them until they are older, like middle school age. Some parents need to learn the damaging effects of a phone so I believe there should be a national week of screen free, like in elementary school. We need to go to this level because some parents need to learn and kids need to learn as well what phones can do. This week could include getting info through the mail, not e-mail, on just how to show kids and their parents what the world is like around their phones or kids will only rely on phones too much too soon! On this week, being a horticulturist and raising awareness about gardens, the national parks and the botanical gardens can have free admission so it causes people to get outside and experience nature.</p>
