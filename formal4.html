			<h1>Research</h1>

			<p>Research is done in my field of study by experimentation, just like any other study of science. There needs to be lots of the correct specimens. Just like Gregor Mendel, he did research with peas to figure out genes and traits. He did many years of work and did loads of peas to get things right.</p>

<p>There is all sorts of research being done but different people. If the research involves trees and small fruits, it normally is done by universities, so publicly. Also research can be done privately in by a company, like breeding ornamentals. Breeders at a nursery with do what Mendel did to create new cultivars (varieties) of plants. They can breed for certain traits and emphasize them. They breed Petunias for different color petals or for different leaf colors of coleus. Doing in this and creating new plants can shift the market for businesses to be in their favor. Then once a new plant is on the market and doing well other companies try to get the something so they get ride the success too. Finally is the research involves vegetables then it is done by a combination of private and public.</p>
