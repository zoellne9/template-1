			<h1>Communication</h1>

			<p>Communication is an essential part of Horticulture. The most popular and best way to gets news out in the plant world is through trade shows/ career fairs. Trade shows are giant convention where businesses in the industry from all over come together and present there company. Each company sets up a booth that advertises their business. Also this is where companies can show off any new plant cultivars they have bred. So then on the days of the convention people go in, walk around, and get information from the companies they want to talk to. This makes trade shows a great time to network for new students in the industry and get your name out there. My professor, Dr. Bridget Behe the Horticulture Marketing teacher, told me that and she also said to take a resume and business cards to these shows. </p>

<p>There was a trade show called the Green Industry Conference that happened on October 23rd through the 25th. It was at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Lexington, Kentucky. Horticulture Club, a club here at Michigan State University I am in, went to it. I did not go with them thought but Chris McKellar, a senior in Horticulture, the Treasurer of Horticulture Club, and also an OFA scholar, told me about it in an interview. He told me they all got to walk around and visit all the companies’ booth. Also one of the nights they went to have dinner with a company who has a Michigan State University alumni. The company paid for everything. He said they did an event after the show with the companies can the round table. It is where each company has their own table and the Horticulture Club members could sit and actually talk to the representatives from each company for a bit. Chris said he talk to a guy about organic farming.</p>
<p>Another great form of communication in through scientific papers. These are papers that explain and show the results of an experiment. If one is to form a new way to grow plants through research, they want the world to know. So in order to be know they need to write a scientific paper and get it published, which is very difficult. If one can accomplish this task then they will be well know. Anyways the papers include an abstract (overview of the paper), introduction (introduce the experiment), methods (directions of what was done so someone can repeat it if need be), results (what came out of the experiment), discussion (where the researcher gets to talk about the work they did), and references (also known as the work cited). One the paper is published people can use the technique!</p>
