			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

			<p>Phones are in our everyday lives. We do not even think what we are doing when we pull it out of our pocket to just check the time. People could not even think about doing this in the time of your grandparents’ generation, when they were kids. We have just learned to cope with all this technology like smart phones. We need to learn that with all this power comes responsibility. Like if we use it to much we can lose some precious traits of talking to people and experiencing the world around us. The real issue is that kids are getting smart phones at a very young age. Yes it is the kids’ fault but it mostly falls on the parents. The parents are not setting goo examples of how to use technology and the kids do not know any better than to follow their parents orders. This is a problem that needs to be solved quickly before technology gets out of hand. We need to find solutions so people can use the technology to actually learn rather than use it for unnecessary reasons like games and random junk. So we need a day a month to have screen free to help get this proposal noticed.</p>
