			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>Is it sad that people in developing countries more people have access to a mobile phone then to fresh water, a bank account, or electricity? This means that there are around six billion mobile devices (Information and Communications for Development 2012). Phones today can do so much. Back when they first came out, cell phones could only call. Then texting was invented.  But that is nothing anymore because people can snap chat, Facebook, tweet, Instagram, and surf the web from the little devise! Oh and I forgot the games that one can access on a phone. This just adds to why people have their faces in theirs phones. Just think for a moment how much time you look at your phone to check Facebook or another social media site. It’s a lot, then think how much you use your phone for actually talking. We don’t even use it for talking to people so obviously it’s not helping with actually talking to a person. Also do not forget about how many times people check there phones for a text.  I also am ashamed that I don’t even use my phone to call and use it for texting, but I try to control myself by not having a smart phone, or more like not spending the money on one. I believe kids should not be allowed to have phones till middle school and they should not have a smart phone till they are in college, or not at all.</p>
