		<h1>Greenhouses</h1>
		<p>Technology is anything that makes something easier. Man has always tried to make life easier for himself, this is where technology steps in. Back when there was no supermarkets people had to grow their own food. New methods of growing came about to get more food and new tools to make it possible to sow more land in less time. Then greenhouses came about to lengthen the growing period to produce more food from one plant. </p>
<p>Greenhouses make growing plants easier by putting them in the ideal climate even when not in the correct climate outside the greenhouse. Greenhouses are special places to growing plants. They can be used year round to grow things, or at least keep them alive. They are important to my major because without greenhouses we could not grow some of the plant here in Michigan. With being a horticulture major I need to be able to grow plant and a greenhouse supports this. A greenhouse is made of glass or plastic. The glass or plastic is penetrated by the sun’s radiation which is then absorbed by the plants. The glass or plastic is heated up and the excess heat from the plants create heat in the greenhouse because the greenhouse is insulated so the heat cannot leave. So inside the greenhouse is hot and humid perfect for plants. There is a fake climate inside the greenhouse now.</p>
<p>I actually got into my major of horticulture, which is the science and art of growing fruits, vegetables, and flowers, because I like being outside with the warm sunlight on your face and breathing in clean air from being around plants. But the greenhouse helps that because I can have this feeling year round, well for the most part. And in the summer it can get really humid in a greenhouse and most people hate humidity, like “my hair is getting frizzy”, but I like the humidity. It warms your lungs and makes them moist. The air just slides in and warms you.</p>
<p>Greenhouses can come in many sizes. The ones here at Michigan State University are large but my friend’s dad has one that is only a few cubic feet. Also his greenhouse does not have clear glass or plastic so one does not have to have a greenhouse a certain way for it to work. As long as it traps and stores heat for plants it is a greenhouse. And the tarp he uses works fine but is not most efficient.</p>
<p>Greenhouses even have technology in them. This includes the irrigation systems and like rotating trays to increase growing area or movable trays to just move plants inside to outside. Water and how it is distributed is important to the plants and the greenhouse. Its helps create the humidity inside and also keep the plants hydrated. A sprinkler system can be hung from the ceiling to water many plants at once and acts as a really rain shower. But water can also be dangerous to the plants because over watering can kill them. So even more technology is need to control the water, like which plants get this much water in a week and so on.</p>
<p>Also greenhouses are most effective in climates like ours. This is because a greenhouse is cheaper to heat then it is to cool. In Florida, inside of a greenhouse can get too hot so the owners have to cool it down which takes a lot of fans to suck the air out and also cold air is going to have to be pumped in. But in Michigan, a greenhouse is heated to just the right temperature and does not cost anything because sunlight is free. Well for colder night, it is still cheaper to heat because the windows get shut and just pump in some warm air and it is all good. Greenhouses can make it so people can trick the plants. A greenhouse can make it so plants that only flowers in the early summer to be grown later in the year so they flower in late summer. Or by allowing nurseries to start growing their plants way before the season starts so they are full size when optimal weather conditions are outside.</p>
<p>An even better way to get the full potential out of a greenhouse is by adding grow lights. These lights give off special wavelengths of light, mostly red and blue which are absorbed by the plant to make food. When the days get shorter one can turn on a grow light to make it seem like the sun is out longer than it actually is. This can make the plant produce flowers or fruit at the end of fall.</p>
<p>I love being in greenhouses. There is this store in Traverse City, which is where I am from, called Garden Goods. Garden Goods has a building filled with garden decorations, seeds, and fertilizers. That stuff is all cool but I like the stuff behind the store. That is where their greenhouse is. I use to love going there with my mom and looking at all the plants. They have a giant greenhouse that I would always want to go into to see all the plants. There are so many different plugs. Plugs are small samples of soil and an already started plant grown from a seed. Common plugs are tomatoes, but these are grown from divisions from a preexisting plant. Back when I was little I just wanted to see all the flower colors and different shapes of the plants, but now that I am actually in Horticulture I can recognize these plants by name like the Helianthus annuus which is a sunflower! I cannot wait for the next time I go into their greenhouse because I will understand more about the plants inside and also more of the science behind the greenhouse.</p>
<p>There are also different kinds of a greenhouse. One is called a hoop house. There are seven of these at the Student Organic Farm (SOF) here at Michigan State. Hoop houses are really special because they can be used year round to grow plants and this is what they do at the SOF. Hoop houses can get really hot in the summer so the sides roll up to allow air flow. Even on sunny days in the winter the hoop houses can get warm so there is a vent above the door so release some heat when needed. I learned all of this on my field trip to the SOF this week.</p>
<p>In conclusion, greenhouse are an important piece of technology to my major of horticulture. Also they have tons of technology in them, including a simple window to allow the hot air to rise up and out. Without them, some plants would not be able to be grown in Michigan. In the end greenhouses maybe a bit pricey (especially the all glass ones) but overall, for a grower, they are the best thing. And there is so much more that I can learn about them and their maintenance because I learned about hoop houses on my trip to the SOF just in the first few weeks of college.</p>
