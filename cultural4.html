			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>

			<p>I have friends who have trouble having a face to face conversation and are better having a text conversation. I actually like to talk to one through text rather than face to face confrontation just because she has gotten so use to texting it is hard for her to make eye contact and to keep the conversation going. It is more like she just laughs when she does not have a response. And another friend seems to always have his nose in his phone every time there is silence or just sometimes when he gets bored. We were in line for a ride at Disney and the whole hour I tried talking to him but he would end the conversation to play a freaking game called Candy Crush Saga! It was annoying that he had to play it just because he had access to it and it just happened to be there. I did not have a smart phone, and still do not, so even if I wanted to I could not have done that. It was rude and the next ride he talked to me because he had wasted all his lives in the game and had to wait a half hour to get one back.</p>
