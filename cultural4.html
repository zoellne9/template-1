			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>

			<p> If you just analyze what actually happens when you text, a text shows we cannot even face a person to talk to them. It is killing our face-to-face relationships. And not just that but also poor grammar, short attention spans with homework, and even can lead to brain cancer (Thompson 2008). Yes it is ok to ask a person where they are or what they are doing but having a full on conversation over texting is absurd. A person’s confidence is dropping with ever text sent almost by the second, it seems, because now a boy will ask out or break up with girls over text so they do not have to face the embarrassment or sadness. It severely cuts confidents of people when it comes down to it. This is because it takes a lot of confidence to talk to someone new and it is naturally hard to talk to people you don’t know. It can even be hard to people you know because you do not want to talk weird or have things be awkward. Texting can make communicating easier because it happens slower them actually talking. This in turn gives time to the person to respond. It sounds lovely does it not? But in reality a conversation is much faster and you need to be able to analyze a conversation fast, and texting takes this practice of learning to deal with a difficult situation away. It is way easier to talk to someone when there is no awkwardness and easier to get away if your just texting, you do not have to actually see their response and know how your comment affects them. You cannot put emotions into texting. It sounds like a good thing but think, do you want a true friend or someone who you talk to through a phone and your image of them is just words on your phone. This not a healthy relationship.</p>

<p>I have friends who have trouble having a face to face conversation and are better having a text conversation. I actually like to talk to one through text rather than face to face confrontation just because she has gotten so use to texting it is hard for her to make eye contact and to keep the conversation going. It is more like she just laughs when she does not have a response. And another friend seems to always have his nose in his phone every time there is silence or just sometimes when he gets bored. We were in line for a ride at Disney and the whole hour I tried talking to him but he would end the conversation to play a freaking game called Candy Crush Saga! It was annoying that he had to play it just because he had access to it and it just happened to be there. I did not have a smart phone, and still do not, so even if I wanted to I could not have done that. It was rude and the next ride he talked to me because he had wasted all his lives in the game and had to wait a half hour to get one back. Also according to Turner, a two-year old girl named Ella can use an Apple iPad. She can do this because her parents let her and this technology is just in her everyday life now (2013). We have come so use to this technology because we have been exposed to it since birth that we can use the technology right out of the box (Turner 2013). Almost like we had it before.</p>
