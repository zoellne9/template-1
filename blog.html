			<p>LED lights are the newest type of lighing system we have. For my HRT 203 class we have to do presentations. One kid did his on LEDs. LEDs actually good for plant because we can control they type of lightwaves that they omit. The light</p>

			<p>So Black Friday is coming up next week. I like going out and shopping but the idea just to make money is sad. They make it so people have to upgrade their stuff if they want to newest and coolest stuff. The new Pokemon games came out, X and Y, but they are only for the 3DS. So in order to play the game I would have to buy a whole new system, which is a lot of money for a college kid. I really want to buy it but I do not have the money so I think I will try to go for something else next week. Anyways I like Pokemon and everyone is like new new new! I think people need to look at would they have. I have all the original games and I am thinking about them now and I am happy with them. They are very nostalgic.</p>
<p>Also I have an N64. I really want to bring a gaming console to college with me but do not want to spend money. I think next semster I will bring my N64 just because it is old and good technology. Yes the graphics are bad but other then that and less characters they are the same as the new games. I love the Wii but it is to much money and a ton of cords. The N64 is simple and easy! I feel others need to do this too (and if people stop buying then store will have to lower their prices!)</p>

			<p>We are fortunate to have suck good high tech technology. But to continue from last week, yes we need to appreciate it but with limits. Technology is anything that makes life easier but I think we are making life a bit too easy for ourselves. We have stairs that climb for us and cars that park themselves. Hey I like to take it easy sometimes but we cannot let things do everything for us. I am a strong believer about using older technology like a hoe and shovel to garden. Fact: gardening is still the most popular hobby but I think people need to do it more or just be outside more.</p>

			<p>I want to expand on what I talked about last week. Think even about everyday items we use today, like a microwave or a freezer! They did not even have super nice once years ago. We take it for granted we can just freeze our food but at one point people could not preserve food for a long period of time, they could use ice blocks and sawdust but eventually the ice would melt. All we have to do is plug in the refrigerator and wa-la we have food that can be fine for weeks. I think we just need to think how privileged we are sometimes.</p>

			<p>Ya know it is so weird how people can easily access a computer now. I mean every college kid like has a laptop but everyone has access to one here. Like think of the library, there are so many computers in there and people can just walk up and use them with no second thought. Now imagine it a few years ago, like 10 to 20. This would be unheard of. Computers where technology then and you could not just have the ability to surf the web. It is so weird how fast technology can really move, even though it sits in place.<p>

			<p>I love technology. Sociel Media is cool too, but sometimes people post the dumbest things. They like to have a false sense of attention. They like to post about how they just went to the bathroom or like omg I just took a picture of myself… look!!!!!!! I think it is sad that this is how people feel satisfied now. I wish people would make themselves look good for something important, not to just freaking take a picture of themselves. I believe people need to spend less time on Facebook. (I hate that Facebook is a proper noun… my computer just corrected it from facebook to Facebook. WHY DOES IT NEED TO BE CAPITILIZED?) Granted it is good sometimes but people need to get out more. They need to learn to not care, this is why I hate the movie <em>Social Media</em> because they needed to make a documentary about Facebook. a.k.a. make Facebook more money!

			<p>Last week I was just so interested in the fact that I learned coding and can understanding it. But this week I am thankful for it. I was talking to my roomate about WRA and I told him I have to learn coding. He told me that it maye hard now but once you have that down, or at least the basics, it is a great skill to have. It is also very marketable! I though about it and never thought of it that way, but it is! It is something really cool I can put on my resume now. I am really thankful I took this class now.

			<p>So I never realized it but being about understand a code for a website is awesome. I am so glad that I learned this. I would talk to my friend all the time about HTML, he would show all the websites he made. I of course wanted to know how so he showed me some stuff and my brain just could not handle what I was looking at. But now that I have Used CodeAcademy I understand it. I love it actually! I thought I would hate web design. It is quite interesting how kind of easy it is, like how ul mean unordered list.</p>

			<p>Technology is so amazing. Last night I was having to study for a plant ID quiz and the pictures of them were on my phone. My phone is far from a smart phone, it is a slider phone. Anyways so it has a smart screen and not the best quality pictures. I really wanted to get them on my computer which has a bigger screen, My friend was like, "send them over via bluetooth." She showed me how to access bluetooth on my computer. I was able to send all my pictures to my computer so I could study more efficiently and easier. I was so impressed and I can not wait finally have the ability to print out pictures from my labs. See who needs a smart phone. One can do pretty amazing stuff with out a smart phone.

			<p>This weekend I went camping with Hort Club. Travel is such an awesome thing. We traveled by cars, which this camping trip would not have happened if cars were never invented. Anyways it was a long drive but totally worth it. It was like we went back in time because of all the old technology in the botanical garden. They had a water wheel running in a little river <img src="https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/1376602_611290398922587_1657160328_n.jpg">. It was cool to see how it was run. Also in the house we stayed in, there was a room of all this old antiques. There was a loom, a camera, and an apple peeler. It was cool to see the stuff and what the room would look like from that era.</p>

			<p>People do not really talk to each other anymore. They facebook message each other. I believe facebook is good because one can contact people faraway but people use it too much. The wall is pointless because it is just false attention. I hate how people have to talk about there lives 24/7! They think it is all about them. In the movie, <em>The Social Network</em>, Mark blogs about what he is doing while he is doing it and this bites him back later. To me I hate Facebok even more because of the movie, it shows the A**hole who made it. People want to feel popular so they add as many friends as possible, people just use it for the wrong reasons. </p>
<p>Also it was made for the wrong reason. I believe, even though it was made to have communicate, it separates us physically because instead of talking to people they go to Facebook to check their status and check in on other friends when someone is literally right next to them. It is a huge distraction! I believe it also crushed the English language because people shorten words. They turn sentences into one word by hashtagging. </p>
<p> I think it is sad that this is where the world is going. Granted I am a little beist because I am a plant nerd and like being outside but come on. People feel happiness when their status has the most likes and they like this rush. They need to realize that this is not living. They need to see the world for themselves, not through pictures posted on Facebook from things their friends did!</p>

			<p>The purpose of the video is for the guy to express his feelings about losing his uncle, who is his role model. He is his role modle because they are both gay and have ex-wives and kids. He feels alone becuase no one in his family is like him. His mom did not want her son to turn out like her brother so his mom does not support him, just like his gradfather did not support his uncle.</p>
<p>The video starts by just giving background information. Then he resites a poem from 9th grade. Finally he reads his letter to his Uncle Ronnie. By presenting the poem he shares a personal memory and a meaningful poem. He is not just resiting he is telling a story and he draws us in with his. Then he personalizes but adding emoitio, there is so much emotion. And he can add what we writers can, crying and volume, so his purpose is even stronger.</p>
<p>The structure is background information first. Then a poem he memorized. Finally his letter to his dead uncle.</p>
<p>I realize I need to personalize my paper, more like a person from my peer review group. I need to add an experience about greenhouses and me. I need to bring myself into it more.</p>
