			<p>Technology is so amazing. Last night I was having to study for a plant ID quiz and the pictures of them were on my phone. My phone is far from a smart phone, it is a slider phone. Anyways so it has a smart screen and not the best quality pictures. I really wanted to get them on my computer which has a bigger screen, My friend was like, "send them over via bluetooth." She showed me how to access bluetooth on my computer. I was able to send all my pictures to my computer so I could study more efficiently and easier. I was so impressed and I can not wait finally have the ability to print out pictures from my labs. See who needs a smart phone. One can do pretty amazing stuff with out a smart phone.

			<p>This weekend I went camping with Hort Club. Travel is such an awesome thing. We traveled by cars, which this camping trip would not have happened if cars were never invented. Anyways it was a long drive but totally worth it. It was like we went back in time because of all the old technology in the botanical garden. They had a water wheel running in a little river <img src="https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/1376602_611290398922587_1657160328_n.jpg">. It was cool to see how it was run. Also in the house we stayed in, there was a room of all this old antiques. There was a loom, a camera, and an apple peeler. It was cool to see the stuff and what the room would look like from that era.</p>

			<p>People do not really talk to each other anymore. They facebook message each other. I believe facebook is good because one can contact people faraway but people use it too much. The wall is pointless because it is just false attention. I hate how people have to talk about there lives 24/7! They think it is all about them. In the movie, <em>The Social Network</em>, Mark blogs about what he is doing while he is doing it and this bites him back later. To me I hate Facebok even more because of the movie, it shows the A**hole who made it. People want to feel popular so they add as many friends as possible, people just use it for the wrong reasons. </p>
<p>Also it was made for the wrong reason. I believe, even though it was made to have communicate, it separates us physically because instead of talking to people they go to Facebook to check their status and check in on other friends when someone is literally right next to them. It is a huge distraction! I believe it also crushed the English language because people shorten words. They turn sentences into one word by hashtagging. </p>
<p> I think it is sad that this is where the world is going. Granted I am a little beist because I am a plant nerd and like being outside but come on. People feel happiness when their status has the most likes and they like this rush. They need to realize that this is not living. They need to see the world for themselves, not through pictures posted on Facebook from things their friends did!</p>

			<p>The purpose of the video is for the guy to express his feelings about losing his uncle, who is his role model. He is his role modle because they are both gay and have ex-wives and kids. He feels alone becuase no one in his family is like him. His mom did not want her son to turn out like her brother so his mom does not support him, just like his gradfather did not support his uncle.</p>
<p>The video starts by just giving background information. Then he resites a poem from 9th grade. Finally he reads his letter to his Uncle Ronnie. By presenting the poem he shares a personal memory and a meaningful poem. He is not just resiting he is telling a story and he draws us in with his. Then he personalizes but adding emoitio, there is so much emotion. And he can add what we writers can, crying and volume, so his purpose is even stronger.</p>
<p>The structure is background information first. Then a poem he memorized. Finally his letter to his dead uncle.</p>
<p>I realize I need to personalize my paper, more like a person from my peer review group. I need to add an experience about greenhouses and me. I need to bring myself into it more.</p>
