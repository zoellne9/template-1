			<h1>Interviews</h1>

			<p>She had two grandmothers that got her interested in Horticulture. One was into Floriculture and the other was into vegetables. They both had big gardens. She got her Bachelor’s at Penn State in Horticulture. And at the same time she got a Bachelor’s in Agricultural Education at Penn State. Then she got her Master’s at Ohio State. And finally got her Ph. D. at Penn State. She had a total of 10 years of college. She has done marketing consumer research for edibles and ornamental. This is 40% of her job. She teaches HRT 207 Horticulture Career Development, HRT 407 Marketing, HRT 102 Food, Fun, and Profit were she teaches with Brad Row, and HRT 404 Horticulture Business Management. This is another 40% of her job. She works directly with growers in Horticulture. She works with trade shows and gives talks where she explains her research results. And this is the final 20% of her job. Her favorite part of teaching is being with her graduate students. She loves seeing them being happy and learning how to brand themselves. Also she said, “it is like have a lot of children.” I met with her before her HRT 407 class and I could tell she loved her senior because she got happy looking at the small group getting ready for the day and talking with the OFA representative. She gave me last words of wisdom, she just wants me to learn to market myself. As soon as I asked this question she say, “MARKETING! MARKETING! MARKETING!” Then she added I need to learn to brand myself to set myself apart. (Behe)</p>

<p>I also interview Chris McKellar. He talked about the Green Industry Conference and Horticulture Club. He just added that being an officer in Horticulture Club is a great thing to put on a resume. Finally he added that he was an OFA Scholar. He said this is a great experience, because when he went to the OFA trade show he wore a lanyard with a ticket saying he was a scholar. He told me that people literally jumped from their booths to talk to him. He said that they really wanted him to just talk to them and also they really wanted his information so he could work for them.</p>
